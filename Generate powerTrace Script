#How to run:
#go to https://repl.it/languages/python3 and copy-paste the code (you can include the hashtagged lines, these are comments) into the right hand side. Click run.
#The interpreter is a bit slow, make sure you wait until it's finished (it'll say "=>None")
#What it'll do is spit out rows (specified by your input) of 4 random numbers between 0 and whatever upper bound you specify.

import random
steps = int(input("Enter number of timesteps: "))
upperBound = float(input("Enter upper bound: "))
i=0
while(i<steps):
    print(upperBound*random.random(), upperBound*random.random(), upperBound*random.random(), upperBound*random.random())
    i += 1
