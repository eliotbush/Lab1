#How to run:
#go to https://repl.it/languages/python3 and copy-paste the code (you can include the hashtagged lines, these are comments) into the right hand side. Click run.
#The interpreter is a bit slow, make sure you wait until it's finished (it'll say "=>None")
#What it'll do is spit out rows (specified by your input) of 4 random numbers between 0 and whatever upper bound you specify.
#If you have a Python3 IDE (I'm sure XCode has it) you can also just paste this code right in. The file extension is ".py".
#If you're trying to run it on your own and it doesn't interpret, this will not work if you try to run it as a Python 2.*/1.* script.
